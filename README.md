Bamazon is a command line interface application that functions as a storefront. 
Upon launching the app the user is allowed to select a list of items to buy. 
Once the user selects a product a prompt then asks the user how many of the product they would like to purchase.
After the item is selected a user is brought back to the main screen to choose another item. 
If the user chooses a product that is out of stock, a message will inform the user so they can make another product selection.
